.TH JPEGTOAVI 1
.SH NAME
jpegtoavi \- converting JPEGs to an AVI/MJPEG animation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jpegtoavi per_usec width height img1 [img2 ... imgN]
.PP
.B jpegtoavi -f fps width height img1 [img2 ... imgN]
.PP
.B jpegtoavi -fsz img1 [img2 ... imgN]
.PP
.B jpegtoavi --version
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B jpegtoavi
outputs an AVI file containing a single MJPG video stream
given a series of JPEG/JFIF files.  No compression/decompression
steps are involved, nor are any checks made on the validity of
the named JPEG/JFIF files.
.PP
AVI files generated by
.B jpegtoavi
have been successfully viewed with the QuickTime 6 client
for Windows,
Windows Media Player (with an MJPG codec), aviplay, and the xawtv
utility "pia".
.SH OPTIONS
There are three basic modes of operation.  The first, which
prints the AVI to STDOUT, requires the following arguments:
.TP
\fB per_usec
the period in microseconds of the video
.TP
\fB width   
the width of the JPEG/JFIF images (not checked)
.TP
\fB height
the height of the JPEG/JFIF images (not checked)
.TP
\fB img1 ...
names of JPEG/JFIF files (may optionally be passed as
a list on stdin)
.PP
The second is basically like the first, but the frame rate
is specified in frames per second (prefixed by the
.B -f
switch),
which is considered by some people to be more intuitive.
.PP
The third, which prints the size in bytes of the AVI that
could have been generated to STDOUT, requires merely the
.B -fsz
switch and a list of JPEG/JFIF files.  This mode
was actually added to give size hints during the
transfer of AVIs without the use of a temporary buffer.
.SH BUGS, LIMITATIONS, ETC.
In theory this program doesn't support the generation of
AVIs larger than 2 gigabytes in size, however this theory
lacks experimental confirmation.
.PP
This program doesn't claim to work with the whole gamut JPEG/JFIF
files.
